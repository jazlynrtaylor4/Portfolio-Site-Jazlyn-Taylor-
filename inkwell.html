  <p> InkWell is an app that aims to make the entire process of getting a tattoo easier, from choosing a design to finding the best aftercare tips. We want to provide a one-stop shop tattoo resource app.

  <h4> Problem </h4>
  <p> Users need a holistic resource that covers the tattoo process from start to finish so that they can make informed decisions about their design and artist.
  </p>
  <h4> Solution </h4>
  <<p>InkWell is a one-stop shop that guides users through the entire tattoo process and engages them in an informative, interesting online community. It is a space for users to find answers to their questions, find inspiration, explore artistâ€™s

  <h3>User Interviews</h3>
  <h4> First Interview Findings </h4>
  <p>I conducted two sets of interviews. First I sent out a brief survey to friends on social network sites, asking general questions about their tattoo experiences. 29 people participated and the results helped me form my next set of interview
    questions.

  <h4> Second Interview Findings</h4>
  <p> In my second round of interviews. I interviewed three individuals from different cities about their experiences with tattoos. All three have at least two tattoos. Here are my most pertinent findings:
    - None of the participants did any research beforehand and did not know what to expect going into their appointment
    - They stumbled upon their chosen artist or found them through word of mouth.
    - All chose designs intentionally, opting for meaningful symbols of things that they want to commemorate or celebrate forever</p>

  <h3>High Fidelity Protoypes</h3>
  <p>Creating these prototypes was a steep learning curve for me. I initially focused too heavily on the background image rather than visibility of the other elements. As I've reiterated my design, I have made the background simpler, still
    incorporating the initial background design but in much more practical ways. Minimalism is king.</p>
